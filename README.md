# Segmentation with U-Net

The goal of the first part of the exercise (segmentation) is to implement the U-Net architecture very similar to the original publication and then use it for its initial purpose, semantic segmentation. 

To understand the background of this exercise you can:

Read the U-net publication: https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597


Note that we will implement the same ideas as in these papers, but will deviate from the implementation details and conduct different and fewer experiments.

## Project Overview

In this project, we will implement the U-Net architecture for two main tasks: segmentation and denoising. The primary focus is on segmenting nuclei in fluorescence microscopy images.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git

### Cloning the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Segmentation-UNet.git
cd Segmentation-UNet
```
## Downloading the Data

To keep the repository lightweight, the data is not included. You can download the data by running the provided script.

```sh
chmod +x scripts/download_data.sh
./scripts/download_data.sh

```

## Installing Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Notebook
After downloading the data, you can start the Jupyter notebook:



```sh
jupyter notebook notebooks/Segmentation_UNet.ipynb
```

## Project Details

## Importing libraries
First of all we import all required python libraries for completing the task.

- Script: import_libraries.py

## Data Exploration
In this step, we explore the dataset to understand its structure and visualize some examples. This is done in the data_exploration.py script.

- Script: data_exploration.py

## Implement PyTorch Dataset
We implement a custom PyTorch dataset to handle data loading and preprocessing. This implementation can be found in the dataset.py script.

- Script: dataset.py

## Implement the U-Net
We implement the U-Net architecture as described in Ronneberger et al. The code for this is in the unet_model.py script.

- Script: unet_model.py

## Training
We define the training functions and train the model, plotting the results of loss and metrics. The training code is in the training.py script.

- Script: training.py

## Evaluation
We evaluate the model on the test data to assess its performance. This evaluation is done in the evaluation.py script.

- Script: evaluation.py

## Training with Boundary Channel
To avoid merges of touching nuclei, we add a boundary channel to the learning objective and retrain the model. This process is handled in the train_with_boundary.py script.

- Script: train_with_boundary.py

## Training with Dice Loss
For robustness against class imbalance, we will use the Dice coefficient as loss

- Script: train_with_dice_loss.py

## Results
The results of the segmentation task jupyter notebook will be stored in the results/ directory as a pdf.
